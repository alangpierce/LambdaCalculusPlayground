# Lambda Calculus Playground

An Android app that lets you build, combine, modify, and evaluate expressions in the untyped lambda
calculus, all using a touch interface.

The project is currently in development. I'm making this as a way of teaching myself Android
development, so there's a good chance that it won't ever get to a releasable state, but we'll see!
